Scene 1 - Outside the House

*Kathegras - K*

// Kathegras walks in from the right

K: This's the place, it is.
K: Doesn't quite match the description, does it?
K: 'A foul house - a gathering of devils, fiends, and other horned miscreants'.
K: My granny's grave, this place hasn't seen evil in years. // roll eyes

// Kathegras turns around, walks a few steps
// Stops
// Turns back around

K: Ah, I'll have me a gander about - spread some sage, mayhap.
K: That'll be good enough to get paid. // roll eyes

// Kathegras opens the door and walks inside
// Fade out
